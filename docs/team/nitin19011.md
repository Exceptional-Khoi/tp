# Nitin - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
FitChasers is a desktop-based fitness tracking application that enables users to log, organize, and analyze their workout
progress through a clean command-line interface. It is written in Java and comprises ~4 kLoC with an emphasis on modular
design, validation, and user experience.

### 🏋 Feature: Workout Exercise and Set Management
- Implemented `/add_exercise` and `/add_set` commands, enabling detailed logging of exercises and multiple sets per workout.
- Integrated `Exercise` and `Set` into the `Workout` aggregate for a clean hierarchy and easier rendering.
- Added validations for empty names, non-numeric reps, and out-of-sequence usage (e.g., adding sets before an exercise).
- Provided friendly, consistent error messages and confirmations.

**Justification:** Enables granular progress tracking while keeping input robust and predictable.

---

### ⚖ Feature: Weight Tracking Enhancements
- Improved `/add_weight` and `/view_weight` (format checks, default date handling, chronological listing).
- Added strict validation for weight range and date format (`dd/MM/yy`), with clear feedback.
- Strengthened persistence via `WeightManager` to maintain a reliable long-term record.

**Justification:** Supports long-term progress monitoring and reduces user mistakes.

---

### 🔒 Feature: Robust Validation for Core Commands
- Standardized validation + error handling for:
    - `/create_workout` (date/time format, overlapping session prevention),
    - `/add_exercise`, `/add_set` (workflow order + numeric constraints),
    - `/end_workout` (end time after start time),
    - `/delete_workout` (graceful handling of invalid indices).
- Unified error text conventions across commands for a consistent CLI experience.

**Impact:** Fewer crashes, clearer guidance, and easier testing due to predictable failure modes.

---

### 🧩 Technical Depth Highlights (selected)
- **Overlap detection:** Linear-time checks against existing sessions; defensive ordering guarantees in `WorkoutManager`.
- **Input parsing discipline:** Prefix-token parsing with targeted validators; avoids partial-state writes on failure.
- **Persistence safety:** Guarded read/write boundaries and error-surfacing to the UI, keeping domain logic side effect free.

## 📘 Documentation

### User Guide Contributions
- Wrote and refined command sections for workout/weight tracking with consistent examples and error cases.
- Cleaned formatting (headings, code blocks, parameter tokens) and standardized tone across sections.

### Developer Guide Contributions
- Authored **Instructions for Manual Testing** and improved overall structure/ToC.
- Added/updated examples (e.g., `/view_log` usage, pagination/detailed view flags).
- Reviewed diagrams and ensured doc-feature parity (text and screenshots reflect current behavior).

---

## 🤝 Team-Based Contributions
- Triaged issues, coordinated merges before milestones, and fixed CI breakages where necessary.
- Performed code reviews focused on validation correctness, command parsing, and adherence to coding standards.

## ✅ Effort & Completeness Notes (for evaluators)
- Enhancements are **complete and integrated** (parsing → validation → domain → persistence → UI).
- Validation framework reduces error-proneness and simplifies future feature additions.
- Documentation and testing work directly support onboarding, grading, and future maintenance.
