### 🏋 Feature: Workout Exercise and Set Management
* Implemented `/add_exercise` and `/add_set` commands, allowing users to record exercises and track multiple sets under each workout session.
* Integrated the `Exercise` and `Set` classes into the `Workout` structure to maintain a consistent hierarchy between workouts, exercises, and individual performance data.
* Added validation to prevent empty exercise names, invalid repetitions or weights, and out-of-sequence commands.
* Ensured seamless error handling and user feedback during exercise and set creation.

**Justification:**  
This feature provides detailed session tracking, enabling users to log progress at a granular level. The validation logic ensures consistency in user inputs, reducing errors and maintaining data accuracy.

---

### ⚖ Feature: Weight Tracking Enhancements
* Contributed to the `/add_weight` and `/view_weight` features to help users monitor and visualize their weight progression over time.
* Added validation for date and weight formats, ensuring entries are consistent and correctly parsed.
* Improved file handling and integration with the `WeightManager` to support long-term data persistence.

**Justification:**  
These enhancements provide a reliable way for users to record physical progress, improving motivation and long-term tracking accuracy.

---

### 🔒 Feature: Robust Validation for Core Commands
* Added input validation and defensive error handling for multiple commands:
    - `/create_workout`: Validates date/time and prevents overlapping sessions.
    - `/add_exercise` & `/add_set`: Enforces logical workflow and numeric constraints.
    - `/end_workout`: Prevents invalid time ranges and overlapping workouts.
    - `/delete_workout`: Checks invalid indices or nonexistent workouts gracefully.
* Standardized error message formats for all commands, ensuring consistent and user-friendly feedback.

**Justification:**  
This validation framework strengthened overall program reliability, ensuring FitChasers handled incorrect input gracefully while maintaining smooth CLI interaction.
